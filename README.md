Welcome to Combined Games! This is a personal project where I brought together two of my favorite classic games—Tic-Tac-Toe and Rock-Paper-Scissors—into one retro-inspired website. I designed everything from the pixel art graphics to the sound effects, aiming for a fun, nostalgic experience you can enjoy solo or with friends.

## ✨ What’s Inside?

- **Tic-Tac-Toe**: Play against a friend or challenge yourself in single-player mode. The board and icons are all custom pixel art.
- **Rock-Paper-Scissors**: Classic gameplay with a twist—multiplayer and single-player options, plus animated overlays and sound effects.
- **Retro Vibes**: Every detail, from the font to the cursors, is crafted for a pixel-perfect look.
- **Sound & Music**: Enjoy background music and effects that make each move feel satisfying.
- **Responsive**: Works great on desktop and 1600x720 screens.
